Requirements: Adobe Flex SDK 4.6 and my iggy_as3_test (the executable, not the source)

Compile instructions: <br>
- The flex sdk bin folder must be added to your PATH. <br>
- iggy_as3_test must be in your path too (either that or added to the base directory) <br>
- An existing ITEMLIST_DETAILS.iggy from the game must be placed on the base directory. It should be from the same version that the "currently based" version listed at the bottom of this readme. <br>
- Just run compile.bat, the .iggy file you placed will be updated in place with the code. The .bat will also try to automatically copy it to the location of a default DBXV2 installation. You may want to modify the path in compile.bat if you have your game in a different location. <br>

Currently based on game version: 1.22.1 (SHA256: 70FEB837CEDD4141720A4943EE6A8E3F1CEE91B4AEC880E721BC5D09A932461E)
